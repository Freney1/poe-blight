# Generators

These Ruby scripts are used to generate the latest versions of the application's JSON anointment data. They accomplish this by leveraging data made publicly available by GGG before a new patch.

## Dependencies
* Ruby (2.4.1+)

## Usage
### Passives

##### 1. Download the passive tree data when it becomes available. Modify the URL and filenames as appropriate.

```
cd tmp
wget https://web.poecdn.com/public/news/2020-03-14/Delirium/3100_PassiveSkillTree.zip
unzip 3100_PassiveSkillTree.zip
mv 3100/data.json .
rm -rf 3100*
cd ..
```

##### 2. Run the script to generate the updated file

```
ruby generate_passives.rb
```

After running the script, the `passives.json` file used by the application will be updated with the latest data.

### Tower Enchantments

##### 1. Update `enchantments.csv` with the latest data

A table of new tower enchantments should be provided by GGG shortly before a new patch. ([Example](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2874150)) You will need to transform this table into CSV and add the new rows to the `enchantments.csv` file in this directory.

```

##### 2. Run the script to generate the updated file

```
ruby generate_enchantments.rb
```

After running the script, the `enchantments.json` file used by the application will be updated with the latest data.

**Note:** The description is left blank since it is not provided by GGG, and will need to be updated from another source, like the wiki.
