# Path of Exile - Blight Helper

This web application is an experiment with the Vue.js framework, designed to be a helpful tool used alongside [Path of Exile's](https://www.pathofexile.com) [Blight League](https://www.pathofexile.com/blight).

The Blight League introduces a new mechanic called "anointing" which allows players to augment various items with oils found throughout the league. This application removes the hassle of trial and error by providing a fully searchable database of anointments. This is paired with a simulator which provides the user with a visual representation of their desired oil combinations and also allows for experimentation. Oils can be combined to produce oils of a higher tier. For this, the application also provides a "solver" which allows users to input their current quantities of oils and see which anointments are available to them.
